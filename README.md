## Cloud-Native DevOps Project (Part 2 of 5)

## Background

Our University Library is a cornerstone of academic resources, aims to enhance accessibility to educational materials through an advanced online platform. 
You has been asked to develop a cloud-native microservices architecture to support the libraryâ€™s diverse user base and streamline deployment processes.

## Tasks

In this task, you are continuing work from the previous project, focusing on Dockerizing the book_catalog microservice and deploying it to Local Kubernetes.
This task builds upon previous efforts, emphasizing practical skills in containerization, database integration with PostgreSQL, and deployment orchestration with Kubernetes in a local development environment. 
By the end of this project, you will gain hands-on experience in setting up and managing containerized applications, leveraging Kubernetes for scalability and management efficiencies.

## Steps

1. Downlaod code from the Task Resources and unzip.
2. Create a github repository named : <your-name-sit722-part2> .
3. Add given code to a github repository (local first then push to the remote repo).
4. Write Dockerfile.
5. Create deployment.yaml for each microservice.
6. Deploy Microservice to Local Kubernetes.
